# JSON Data Backup - Migration to PostgreSQL

**Date**: 2025-06-13 04:35:28
**Reason**: Migration from JSON file storage to PostgreSQL database

## What was moved here:
- `creators.json` - 2 creators with platforms and content
- `content_sets.json` - 3 content sets (deduplicated to 2 in database)
- `cards.json` - 13 content cards (10 migrated after deduplication)
- `json_data_impl.py` - JSON data implementation (no longer used)

## Data integrity after migration:
- **PostgreSQL Database**: 2 creators, 2 sets, 10 cards
- **Deduplication**: Removed duplicate lunar_explorer content sets
- **Schema changes**: Added `platforms` JSONB array support
- **Backward compatibility**: Maintained legacy `platform`/`platform_handle` fields

## Migrated content:
1. **lunar_explorer_original** - "Lunar Explorer"
   - 1 content set, 3 cards
   - Theme: Space exploration + health/hydration

2. **anacontti50mais_dc55d49d** - "Longe Vida"
   - 1 content set, 7 cards  
   - Theme: Wellness for women 50+

## API changes:
- Switched from `JSONCreatorData` to `PostgreSQLCreatorData`
- Updated models to support `platforms` array instead of single platform
- All endpoints now use PostgreSQL exclusively
