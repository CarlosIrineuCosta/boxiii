## Safety Notes

- **Current branch**: `pwa-dev` (active development)

- **All changes are committed regularly for safety**

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Stay in pwa-dev branch** for all development
2. **Test deployments** before major changes
3. **Document decisions** in appropriate files
4. **Keep structure simple** until proven workflow
5. **Don't delete old branches** until new structure is verified
