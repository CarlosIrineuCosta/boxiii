## Proposed Upgrades

### AI Model Selection Enhancement
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Add dynamic model selector dropdown in Generate Cards interface

**Current State**: Fixed model configuration in backend code
- Gemini: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17` (most cost-effective)
- Claude: `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (cheapest vs expensive Sonnet 4)  
- OpenAI: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective GPT-4 class)

**Proposed Implementation**:
1. **Frontend Model Selector**: Dropdown in Generate Cards page allowing users to choose:
   - **Gemini Models**: 
     - `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (cheapest, fastest)
     - `gemini-2.5-flash` (balanced performance/cost)
     - `gemini-2.5-pro` (highest quality, most expensive)
   - **Claude Models**:
     - `claude-3-haiku` (cheapest, fast)
     - `claude-3-sonnet` (balanced)
     - `claude-3-opus` or `claude-4-sonnet` (premium, expensive)
   - **OpenAI Models**:
     - `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-effective)
     - `gpt-4o` (higher quality, more expensive)

2. **Backend Model Management**: Extend `MODEL_CONFIG` dictionary to support multiple models per provider

3. **Cost Estimation**: Display estimated generation cost based on model selection and card count

4. **User Preferences**: Save user's preferred model selection per creator

**Business Value**: 
- Allows users to balance cost vs quality based on content importance
- Premium users can access higher-quality models
- Provides clear cost transparency
- Enables tiered pricing strategy

**Technical Requirements**:
- Update `unified_generator.py` MODEL_CONFIG structure
- Modify Generation API to accept model parameter
- Add model selector component to GeneratePage.tsx
- Implement cost calculation logic
- Add model preference storage

**Estimated Development Time**: 2-3 days
