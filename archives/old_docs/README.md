# Old Documentation Archive

**Created**: June 13, 2025  
**Purpose**: Backup of duplicate and outdated README files during documentation cleanup

## Contents

### builder-frontend/
- `README.md` - Original Vite + React + TypeScript template README
- **Status**: Generic template documentation, superseded by main project README
- **Reason for archiving**: No unique project-specific information

### viewer-docs/
- `README.md` - Original viewer-specific documentation
- **Status**: Contains some useful architectural information about numbering systems
- **Reason for archiving**: Partially outdated due to database migration, but preserved for reference
- **Key Information**: Set/card numbering system, image organization structure

### image-guides/
- Various README.md files from viewer image directories
- **Status**: Operational guides for image placement and organization
- **Reason for archiving**: Content-specific rather than architectural, preserved for reference

## Important Notes

- **Main Documentation**: All current and authoritative documentation is in the root README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Database Migration**: Some information in archived viewer docs may be outdated due to PostgreSQL migration
- **Tailwind v4**: Technology references in archived docs predate the major Tailwind v4 migration

## Recovery

If any information from these archived docs is needed:
1. Check if it's already covered in the main documentation
2. Update and integrate relevant information into main docs
3. Do not restore these files to their original locations without updating them first
